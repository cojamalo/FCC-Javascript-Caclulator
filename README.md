# FCC-Javascript-Caclulator

Completion Date: Nov 22, 2016

This is the repository for my completion of the freeCodeCamp "Build a Javascript Calculator" project. Formatted for mobile use.

A working version is at https://codepen.io/cojamalo/pen/VmpYMp.

The project is an example of a javascript calculator app. Formatted using CSS, the calculator is fully functional.

Project coded by Connor Lenio - released into the public domain for educational purposes in 2016.
